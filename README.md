##### Q1 ) How do we measure forty-five minutes using two identical wires, each of which takes an hour to burn. We have matchsticks with us. The wires burn non-uniformly. So, for example, the two halves of a wire might burn in 10 minute and 50 minutes respectively

**Ans)** So we have two wires, wire 1 and wire 2 both of which takes 60 minutes to burn. If we burn wire 1 from both sides then it would take 30 minutes to burn the wire.
So this way we can measure 30 min.

But if we say when we ignite wire 1 from both sides, then simultaneously we also ignite wire 2 from one side. When the wire 1 finishes, wire 2 would have 30 min left as well(As both took 1 hour to burn), then we ignite the other end of wire 2 as well. Then the wore 2 would finish in 15 min. Hence 30 min from wire 1 and 15 min from wire 2, 30 + 15 = 45 minutes

###### Q2 )  Alok has three daughters. His friend Shyam wants to know the ages of his daughters. Alok gives him first hint.
1) #####The product of their ages is 72.
2) #####Shyam says this is not enough information Alok gives him a second hint.
3) #####The sum of their ages is equal to my house number.
4) #####Shyam goes out and look at the house number and tells “I still do not have enough information to determine the ages”.
5) #####Alok admits that Shyam can not guess and gives him the third hint
6) #####The oldest of the girls likes strawbarry ice-cream.
7) #####Shyam is able to guess after the third hint. Can you guess what are the ages of three daughters?

**Ans)** We have to find out two sets of 3 number which product is 72 but the sum is constant

These two sets are 3,3,8 and 2,6,6
Then Alok says he has one eldest daughter that means answer is 3,3,8

##### Q2) Two trains enter a 200 km long tunnel from two different sides. Spped of both trains is 100km/hr. A bee also enters the tunnel with train 1 and can fly with a speed of 1000km/hr, when it reaches train 2 it again starts flying towards train 1, this continue till both the trains collide. How much distance has bee travelled?
**Ans)** Many people approach this by trying to find a series of distance travelled by the bee. This approach is quite complex. A Better approach is Tunnel is 200 km long, and two trains with speed of 100 km/hr enters the tunnel, we can put one train on rest and other would have 200 km/hr speed, that is they both will collide after 1 hr. Speed of bee is 1000km. so d = s*t = 1000*1 = 1000 km
