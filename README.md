##### How do we measure forty-five minutes using two identical wires, each of which takes an hour to burn. We have matchsticks with us. The wires burn non-uniformly. So, for example, the two halves of a wire might burn in 10 minute and 50 minutes respectively

So we have two wires, wire 1 and wire 2 both of which takes 60 minutes to burn. If we burn wire 1 from both sides then it would take 30 minutes to burn the wire.
So this way we can measure 30 min.

But if we say when we ignite wire 1 from both sides, then simultaneously we also ignite wire 2 from one side. When the wire 1 finishes, wire 2 would have 30 min left as well(As both took 1 hour to burn), then we ignite the other end of wire 2 as well. Then the wore 2 would finish in 15 min. Hence 30 min from wire 1 and 15 min from wire 2, 30 + 15 = 45 minutes
